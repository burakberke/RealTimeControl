# RealTimeControl
The aim of my project is to save water in greenhouses. With the rain sensor on 
the greenhouse, the roof opens when it rains.Thus, rainwater feeds the plants. 
Then the greenhouse is covered when there is no rain. In this way, I reduce the 
cost by saving in water use. I will be able to learn how many degrees the roof will 
open and how long it will remain open with the potentiometer
